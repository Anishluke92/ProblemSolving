We'll say that a value is "everywhere" in an array if for every pair of adjacent elements in the array, at least one of the pair is that value. Return true if the given value is everywhere in the array.

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 1) → true

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3], 2) → false

isEverywhere([1, 2, 1, 3, 4], 1) → false
so you are checking if the number is the target or if the next number if the target.

so when this is not the case, when you have found a number that does not have a neighbouring number we are looking for, why don't you just return the whole method as false at that point. why wait till the array loop is finished and why then again loop through (when you do .include?) to find out if there is a 1 in the array to then return true and false in the end.

Better algorithm:

if you find a number that is not neighbouring the target just return false.
if you get to the end of the array and you have not returned false, then you can return true because the number is everywhere.
you can't return true. if you do that then it will check the first number and where it's true, it will just stop and return true. won't check other numbers.

we should only return false when we know its NOT there. so we can stop the program early. Otherwise we will have to go through all and check if it is true...
